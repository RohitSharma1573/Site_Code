      <p>
        The rich heritage of India, one of the<b> world’s oldest civilizations</b>, is an all-embracing confluence
         of religions, traditions and customs. The highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its 
         art, architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate secular philosophy of its
         people. A visit to the heritage sites is like a walk through history, changing lanes with every
         dynasty that ruled Indian soils. The finesse of Indian handiwork, the richness of silk and cotton 
         textiles, the ethnicity of jewellery, everything has come down as a <b>heritage from ancient times</b> and 
         is being kept alive generation after generation. Even food in India is a legacy and part of Indian 
         heritage, differing in look and taste in every state of India.

          The elders should take responsibility to invoke love for the Indian heritage in the younger generations.
           This must be done from the very beginning only then we can preserve our rich heritage. It is the duty of 
           the elders to invoke love for the Indian heritage in the younger generations.<br><br>
           This must be done from the very beginning only then we can preserve our rich heritage. 
           Schools must teach students about Indian heritage and how it has survived for centuries. 
           They must also share the importance of preserving it. This would help in invoking a 
           feeling of pride in them and they would be inspired to continue the tradition and also 
           pass it on to the new generation. This needs a collective effort by the teachers as well 
           as parents.

          <p>Vaishno Devi, also known as Mata Rani, Trikuta, Ambe 
            and Vaishnavi, is a manifestation of The Hindu Mother 
            Goddess, Devi. The words "Maa" and "Mata" are commonly 
            used in India for mother, and thus are often heavily 
            used in connection with Vaishno Devi.According to Hindu 
            religion, in the Treta Yuga, when the earth was overburdened 
            by the wicked and tyrannical rule of the demons, the Goddess 
            Vaishnavi was created when Mahakali, Lakshmi and Saraswati 
            decided to combine their energies to rid the earth of impending 
            doom. From the collective energy of the three Goddesses, appeared 
            an eight armed Goddess, who was riding upon a lion (or tiger). After 
            destroying the demons that were burdening Mother Earth, Goddess 
            Vaishnavi was requested to reside on Earth, so that she may forever 
            keep all evil at bay. She chose to incarnate as a human, named 
            Vaishnavi. &nbsp;<a href="" class="qq14">Read More....</a></p>

            " Varanasi, the city that is more than just the spiritual capital of
